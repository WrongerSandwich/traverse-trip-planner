# Traverse

A personal road-trip filing cabinet — managed via Claude Code. Trips live as markdown; status is encoded by both folder location and frontmatter so files are self-describing. Fly-in destinations are out of scope — every idea should be drivable from `home.md`'s `home_coords`.

## Personal context

User-specific details (home base, vehicle, travelers, taste, seasonal preferences, recurring weekly commitments) live in `home.md`. **Always read `home.md` before generating, evaluating, or deepening trip ideas.** Its frontmatter is the source of truth for structured values like home coordinates, default travel radius, and vehicle specs; its prose is the source for taste and constraints.

When a user preference or constraint surfaces that isn't in `home.md`, flag it rather than silently encoding it in a trip file.

## Lifecycle

Trips progress through four stages. Earlier-stage fields are never removed — structure accrues as a trip matures.

1. **idea** — single `.md` file in `ideas/`. Fields: `title`, `status`, `destination`, `pitch`, `created`, `vibe`. Target: <30 seconds to create.
2. **exploring** — promoted to a folder. `overview.md` carries expanded frontmatter; siblings `route.md`, `stops.md`, `logistics.md` appear as research fleshes them out.
3. **planning** — concrete dates, lodging, reservations. The frontend's planning page enables in-place editing of any section + an "Ask Claude" chat that writes section updates back to disk.
4. **completed** — moved to `completed/` with a `notes.md` retrospective.

**Archive (orthogonal to lifecycle):** any trip can be archived via the detail view. Archived trips move to `archived/<source-stage>/<slug>/` with the original status frontmatter intact. The frontend never displays them, but the seed action still scans them so previously-rejected destinations don't get re-suggested.

## Frontmatter schema

**Minimum (idea):**
```
title, status, destination, pitch, created, vibe
```

**Added at exploring:**
```
region, home_distance_mi, driving_hours, duration_days, weekend_viable,
best_seasons, avoid_months, travelers, pet_sitter_needed, ev_friendly,
vehicle (optional override), tags, vibe, cost_tier, waypoints
```
Optional flags: `national_park: true` (for NPS units), `starred: true` (bookmarked)

**Added at planning:**
```
target_date, pet_sitter, lodging, reservations_needed,
charging_stops (EV trips), cost_estimate_usd
```
Optional planning flag: `locked: true` (trip is frozen; itinerary has been generated)

### Field notes

- `vibe` — short phrase describing the trip character (e.g. `"quirky mountain town"`, `"coastal scenic drive"`). Required at idea stage.
- `waypoints` — key cities along the driving route as an inline array: `[Overland Park KS, Leavenworth KS, Atchison KS]`. Used by the frontend to fetch an OSRM road-following route line. Required for the solid route line to appear on the map.
- `national_park: true` — add to any trip where the primary draw is an NPS unit (national park, preserve, scenic riverway). Surfaces a badge on the trip card.
- `starred: true` — bookmarked trip. Toggled by the frontend; write it here if pre-seeding a bookmark.
- `locked: true` — trip is frozen. Editing and Ask Claude are disabled. An AI-generated `itinerary.md` exists in the same folder. Unlock to resume editing; re-lock to regenerate the itinerary.
- `cost_tier` — `budget` | `mid` | `splurge`.

Omit fields rather than guess at creation. Dates are ISO 8601. Distances default to miles.

## In-browser actions

All lifecycle operations live in the SvelteKit app — the browser is the canonical interface.

- **Seed** (`+` button on the home page) — generates 5 new idea files using `home.md` preferences. Optional steering prompt to focus the batch (e.g. "fall colors within 4 hours", "scenic byways with quirky small towns"). Streams progress over SSE.
- **Add destination** (pin button on the home page) — generates a single idea file for a specific destination you name. Includes a semantic duplicate check against existing trips.
- **Research →** (button on idea cards) — promotes an idea into an exploring-stage folder with web-searched details: hours, prices, lodging, route highlights, logistics. Adds `waypoints` so the OSRM route line draws on the map. Cancellable mid-run (the cancel button aborts the in-flight model call, not just the listener).
- **Start Planning** (exploring trips) — promotes `exploring/<slug>/` → `planning/<slug>/` and rewrites the status frontmatter.
- **Bookmark** (star icon) — toggles `starred: true|false` in the trip's frontmatter.
- **Lock trip** (planning detail view) — synthesizes a day-by-day `itinerary.md` from the existing sections (streamed in real time), then sets `locked: true`. Editing and the assistant chat are hidden while locked.
- **Unlock to edit** (locked detail view) — clears `locked: true`. The `itinerary.md` is kept but editing is restored. Re-lock to regenerate the itinerary.
- **Print / Save PDF** (locked detail view) — opens the browser print dialog with print CSS that hides all chrome so only the itinerary renders.
- **Share** (any detail view, when `TRAVERSE_SHARE_SECRET` is set) — generates a public read-only `/share/<token>` URL backed by an HMAC of the slug. Disabling revokes access immediately.
- **Archive** (detail view, gated by confirm) — moves the trip to `archived/<stage>/<slug>/`. The trip vanishes from the UI but stays in the seed-avoidance list.

### Ad-hoc research via Claude Code

`.claude/agents/researcher.md` defines a `researcher` subagent that Claude Code can dispatch for one-off destination research outside the formal lifecycle ("what's the best time of year to visit Glacier?"). It's not invoked by any in-browser action — those reimplement the research loop directly via `chat()` + the `web_search` tool. Use the subagent when you want Claude Code to do exploratory research without writing files.

## Frontend

The SvelteKit app in `src/` is the primary interface. Two ways to run it:

- **Dev:** `npm run dev -- --port 3456` (hot reload)
- **Prod:** `npm run build && pm2 restart traverse` (or `node build/index.js`) — what runs on the home server

The frontend reads trip data from the markdown files on each page load. All three external lookups are disk-backed and persist across restarts:

- `.geocode-cache.json` — Nominatim destination + waypoint coordinates
- `.image-cache.json` — Pexels photo URLs
- `.route-cache.json` — OSRM road route geometries

`enrichTrips()` runs a GC pass each request that prunes orphaned cache entries (e.g. when a trip is deleted or its `waypoints` change), guarded so a transient empty trip list can't wipe everything.

Routes themselves are **not** shipped in the SSR HTML — that bloated each page load by ~80 KB. They're served lazily via `/api/route/[slug]` and fetched client-side when a card is hovered/scrolled-into-focus.

After adding or renaming trips, the next page load picks them up automatically; no manual cache warming needed.

## Conventions

- File names: kebab-case, no dates (e.g. `ozarks-backroads.md`)
- Never remove frontmatter fields during promotion; only add or refine
- When uncertain about a field at creation, omit it
- Research subagents write to their own files (`route.md`, `stops.md`, etc.) and summarize in `overview.md`; no silent edits to user-written prose
- Distance, radius, and vehicle-specific logic read from `home.md` frontmatter; don't hardcode user-specific numbers in commands or subagents
- All model calls go through `chat()` in `src/lib/server/ai.js`; all web search goes through `search()` / `searchToolDefinition()` in `src/lib/server/search.js`. Don't `import Anthropic` (or any other SDK) in route handlers — add a new adapter under `src/lib/server/{ai,search}/` instead. Pass a `label` to `chat()` so token-usage logs are grouped by feature.
- Page data on every route includes `data.features` (from `getFeatureAvailability()`) and `data.assistantName` (from `TRAVERSE_ASSISTANT_NAME`). Use them to gate UI affordances and render assistant-name strings rather than hardcoding.
- `npm run smoke` does a 1-token round-trip per configured provider plus a tool-loop probe when search backend is non-builtin. Run it before deploys and after env changes.
- After a meaningful unit of work, commit and push — the repo is on GitHub at `WrongerSandwich/traverse`
